| 📑 | Optimal Gas Consumption in Ethereum Smart Contracts: A Targeted Review of Empirical Results, Design Patterns and Formal Methods |

| 🔎 | Gas optimization is a critical concern in the development of Ethereum smart contracts, with substantial implications for both cost-efficiency and security. This review systematically examines the latest peer-reviewed research on gas consumption in Solidity contracts, focusing on how micro-level decisions such as function implementation, data member usage, and storage patterns as well as macro-level architectural choices, including object-oriented structures like aggregation and inheritance, influence gas usage. Empirical findings reveal that persistent storage operations and cross-contract calls represent the highest gas expenditures, while optimization techniques such as struct and variable packing, use of immutables, and minimized storage access can yield significant savings. Object-oriented features, although beneficial for modularity, tend to increase gas costs if not carefully managed. The adoption of formal verification frameworks ensures the correctness of automated optimizations and prevents the introduction of subtle bugs. Furthermore, network-level gas price volatility underlines the need for continuous benchmarking and adaptive strategies. Overall, the review demonstrates that effective gas optimization requires an integrated approach, combining empirical measurement, code-level best practices, formal guarantees, and awareness of evolving network conditions. |

| 📑 | Blockchain Transaction Graph Analysis Using Image Processing Techniques |

| 🏛️ | IEEE 25th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI 2025) |
| 🔎 | Blockchain technologies generate large-scale transaction data that can be modeled as complex directed graphs. Traditional analysis methods focus on topological and statistical properties of these graphs, but recent advances in computer vision provide new avenues for structural recognition. This paper presents a system for visualizing Bitcoin transaction graphs and analyzing them through image comparison techniques. Using modular JavaScript tools, the system parses transaction data, generates address-level graphs, renders them as images, and applies pixel-based similarity metrics to identify structural patterns. The evaluation shows that visually similar transaction types yield high similarity scores, while outliers are effectively distinguished. The results support the viability of image-based graph analysis as a supplementary method for blockchain transaction monitoring and anomaly detection. |

| 🔎 | Since their emergence, social platforms have rapidly evolved, with the internet playing an increasingly significant role in everyday life. Constant user activity generates vast amounts of data, making digital spaces not only sources of information but also valuable for analyzing human behavior and virtual social interactions. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of social platforms is essential, given their widespread influence. A key question arises regarding the factors contributing to the success and impact of online videos and posts. Additionally, effective strategies for maximizing content reach remain an area of interest for content creators and entrepreneurs. To address these aspects, an analytical system has been developed to automate large-scale data collection from social platforms. This system standardizes, processes, and analyzes the gathered data, providing insights through visualizations and statistical evaluations. As part of this study, data from over 20,000 short-form videos were analyzed and compared. Several notable patterns and regularities were identified, offering a deeper understanding of content performance dynamics on social platforms. |

| 🔎 | Most of the traditional voting systems in use today are centralised and centrally organised, making them opaque and unreliable in terms of the authenticity of votes. They suffer from several drawbacks due to their largely physical implementation, including significant human resources, the use of ballot papers and a place for the voting. An online voting web application using a transparent blockchain network on a distributed basis provides an option to address this. The key components of the system are transparency, maintaining voter anonymity using dedicated account addresses, secure multi-factor authentication, site-protected authorisation, and a permanent full online availability. The approach results in users being able to easily cast a vote online from their account and then track its arrival in real time. This solves all the drawbacks associated with a physical presence and saves voters time and energy using the concept. |

| 🔎 | The aim of this research is to develop a system that addresses the shortcomings and limitations of the current, widely used Hungarian Electronic Health Service Space. The engine of the system, presented below, is the Ethereum blockchain, which provides one of the most secure data storage options available today. The blockchain ensures data storage while protecting sen-sitive patient data from tampering and manipulation. Throughout the research, numerous systems were examined with similar functionalities and delved deeply into the world of blockchain during literature review. Although all planned components were developed during the implementation, it was not necessarily in the planned manner due to complications. The development was followed by thorough testing, and in the concluding section, a summary is provided, along with some possibilities for further development mentioned at the end of the research. |

| 🔎 | This paper describes an application, which aims to help people who are doing training exercises at home. The system takes a video as input and provides feedback about the mistakes that were made during the execution of the exercise by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine the limb positions and mathematical calculations to find the angles between them.

| 📑 | PSO based Optimization of DBSCAN Algorithm Parameters for Road Accident Blackspot Localization |

| 🏛️ | IEEE 10th Jubilee International Conference on Computational Cybernetics and Cyber-Medical Systems (ICCC 2022) |
| 🔎 | The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is a well-known data-mining method capable of localization of accident blackspots of the road network based on the already existing road accident database records. However, its parameterization raises many problems, as its operation is significantly different from the traditional Sliding Window (SW) method. This paper presents a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based method to find a base parameter set for the DBSCAN method which gives similar results to the already existing SW. The fitness function of the PSO algorithm is based on the similarity of accident blackspots, which needs a definition of a novel metric. The evaluation results show that the DBSCAN method used with the recommended parameter set is capable to give similar results to the SW method used by road safety experts. |

| 📑 | Key-Value Pair Searching System via Tesseract OCR and Post Processing |

| 🏛️ | IEEE 19th World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI 2021) |
| 🔎 | Optical character recognition systems make it possible to extract text from images. In many cases, this may be sufficient, but there are cases where key-value pairs are required. In this paper, we investigate the use of the open source Tesseract OCR system, to extract text data from images, and perform a key-value pair search. Image noise needs to be minimized with image processing algorithms before recognition. It is necessary to perform so-called post processing procedures on the output of the Tesseract. These post-processors can transform the result of the recognition performed by the OCR system. Those can improve the accuracy of the information extracted during the transformation, for example with the help of regular expressions. The key value pair search is performed after these procedures. |
